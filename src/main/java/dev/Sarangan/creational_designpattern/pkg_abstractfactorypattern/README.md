### Introduction/ Definition:

2. Single Responsibility Principle (**SRP**): It helps to extract the product creation code into one place
3. Open/ Closed Principle (**OCP**): This patterns helps to introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

### Disadvantages:
1. The code become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced in this pattern.
